# Mental-Health-EDA-
The objective of this project is to explore and analyze a dataset containing linguistic,  psychological, and behavioral attributes, with a particular focus on mental health-related features.  Using various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and predictive modeling approaches.
we aim to: 
1. Understand the relationships between the variables. 
2. Perform predictive modeling on key mental health-related outcomes. 
3. Evaluate the performance of Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear 
Regression models for selected target variables.
